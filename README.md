# mord_recipes

This is the finishing project of Odin Project's foundations course. My purpose is to test and implement my freshly-acquired HTML skills through the creation of a web page centered around food recipes. 

I will be putting what I learned in practice in a rather more complex project than the previous excersizes. I am trying to gain some muscle memory for writing HTML, while at the same time trying to comprehend how git and github works to save my progress.
